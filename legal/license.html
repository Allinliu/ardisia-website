<h3>
	1. DEFINITIONS

	source code and/or files of the Software or previous Modifications, or (ii) 
	any new files or code that incorporate any aspect, no matter how small or

	in the marketplace with the the Software or any components of the Software.
</p>
<p>

	can be You (if You are a person), employees, third-party contractors, or 
	any person who is acting under Your control and direction. 
</p>
<p>
	"Apache Flex" is an open-source framework for creating software managed by 
	the The Apache Software Foundation.
</p>
<p>
	the "Apache License" in this Agreement refers to the license that is used by 
	Apache Flex, which is the Apache License version 2.0.
</p>

<h3>
	2. LICENSE GRANT
</h3>
<p>
	Subject to receipt of payment, and subject to Your compliance with all of 
	the conditions of this Agreement, Ardisia Labs LLC hereby grants You a 
	limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable 
	license for Your Named Developers to use the Software to create Products, 
	for You to distribute Your Products, and for end users to use the Software 
	subject to the following conditions.
</p>
<p>
	(i) Each license You purchase entitles You to designate a single Named 
	Developer. A designated Named Developer can be replaced with a new 
	designated Named Developer only after the previous Named Developer holds 
	the status for a minimum of 3 continuous months. The maximum number of 
	Named Developers You can designate is equivalent to the number of licenses 
	You have purchased.
</p>
<p>
	(ii) Only Named Developers can use the Software to create, improve, or 
	maintain Products. The Software is in use when it is loaded into memory or 
	stored on a storage medium like a hard disk. Persons within Your 
	organization can test Your Products without being Named Developers, but 
	system integrators must be Named Developers. For anyone who creates 
	Products on Your behalf, which includes consultants and third-party 
	contractors, You must purchase separate licenses and designate such persons 
	as Named Developers even if such persons have their own licenses to use the 
	Software.
</p>
<p>
	(iii) You must only distribute Your Products in executable object code form, 
	otherwise known as compiled software. You must only distribute the Software 
	as integrated into Your Products, and You must prevent end users from using 
	the Software independently from Your Products. 
</p>
<p>
	(iv) You must not grant redistribution or sublicensing rights to Your 
	Products to end users or third parties.
</p>
<p>
	(v) You must only distribute Your Products pursuant to an enforceable 
	written agreement that is as protective of Us and the Software as this 
	Agreement, which includes provisions for, but is not limited to, 
	prohibitions against redistribution, limits the liability of Your licensors 
	and suppliers to the maximum extend permitted by law, and all other 
	conditions that are consistent with this Agreement. 
</p>
<p>
	However, if Your use of the Software is purely internal and solely for Your 
	benefit, then You are not required to create an enforceable written 
	agreement for Your end users. 
</p>
<p>
	(vi) You hereby acknowledge that You will make reasonable efforts to ensure 
	that the end users' usage of Your Products is in compliance with the 
	Agreement and that You are solely responsible for Your end users and any 
	liability they create due to their breach of these conditions. 
</p>
<p>
	(vii) You acknowledge that the Software's source code is confidential, is 
	valuable, and contains proprietary trade secrets of Ardisia Labs LLC. None 
	of the Software's source code or any modified versions of the source code 
	can be distributed, disclosed, or otherwise made available to any third 
	party and You may not enable or encourage end users to decompile, reverse 
	engineer, or otherwise discover the source code of the Software. You 
	acknowledge that only Named Developers can view the source code for the 
	Software.
</p>
<p>
	(viii) You may not use Ardisia Labs LLC's trade or product names, logos, or 
	trademarks in Your marketing materials without express written permission 
	from Ardisia Labs LLC.
</p>
<p>
	(ix) You must not redistribute documentation for the Software.
</p>
<p>
	(x) You must not remove or alter attribution notices connected with the 
	Software. This includes, but is not limited to, copyright and licensing 
	notices in source code files.
</p>
<p>
	(xi) If You change source code files for the Software, You must cause 
	such files to carry prominent notices at the top of the source code that 
	You changed the files. 
</p>
<p>
	(xii) You must operate under the assumption that the Software is a 
	derivative work of Apache Flex, and therefore You must comply with certain 
	requirements imposed by the Apache License.  Among other things, the Apache 
	License imposes conditions on redistributions of derivative works in 
	Section 4. See the Apache License 2.0.
</p>

<h3>
	3. TRIAL
</h3>
<p>
	In addition to the other terms contained herein, We grant to You a limited, 
	revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to 
	install and use the Software (the "Trial License") strictly for Your 
	internal evaluation purposes and not for production purposes. This Trial 
	License is only applicable if you request a Trial License from Ardisia Labs 
	LLC and your request for the Trial License is granted in Ardisia Labs LLC's 
	sole discretion. The Trial is effective for 30 days following the 
	registration date. You may register for a Trial License once in any 12 month 
	period. You agree not to use a Trial License for any purpose other than 
	making a determination as to whether or not to purchase a license to the 
	Software. You are not permitted to distribute the Software, in any way, to 
	anyone or anything outside the Organization on whose behalf you have 
	obtained the license.
</p>
<p>
	Your rights to the Trial License terminate immediately upon the earlier of 
	(i) the expiration of the 30 day trial period, or (ii) You purchase a 
	license to the Software. We may terminate Your Trial License at any time in 
	Our absolute and sole discretion.
</p>
<p>
	If, after your right to use the Trial License terminates, you have not 
	purchased a license to the Software, you agree to destroy any and all traces
	of the Software. This includes all source code, binaries, and assets as
	stand-alone files or as code or concepts that have moved to other files or 
	other media.
</p>

<h3>
	4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
</h3>
<p>
	Ardisia Labs LLC retains all of our intellectual property rights in the 
	Software unless expressly granted by this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
	Nothing in this agreement restricts Your inherent rights to use Apache Flex 
	nor is Ardisia Labs LLC claiming any ownership of Apache Flex.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, the demos and demo application(s) that are provided to persons
	who purchase a license to use The Software, also include files and assets 
	that are governed by a multitude of different software licenses. You agree 
	that You will be conscious of this fact when using or redistributing any 
	included content from the demos and demo application(s).
</p>

<h3>
	5. ROYALTIES
</h3>
<p>
	You will not owe Ardisia Labs LLC royalties for Your distribution of Your 
	Products as long as You comply with this agreement.
</p>

<h3>
	6. REFUNDS
</h3>
<p>
	Since source code is provided for the Software, there are no refunds.
</p>

<h3>
	7. TERM
</h3>
<p>
	Ardisia Labs LLC shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and 
	terminate Your rights to the Software if You breach any of the material 
	terms of this Agreement. Upon termination of this agreement, Your licenses 
	to the Software are immediately revoked and You agree to immediately cease 
	using the Software. You further agree to destroy any copies of the Software 
	and related documentation.
</p>

<h3>
	8. TERMINATION OF THE SOFTWARE
</h3>
<p>
	Ardisia Labs LLC reserves the right to discontinue the Software or any 
	portion of the Software at any time.
</p>

<h3>
	9. SUPPORT
</h3>
<p>
	You are not entitled to any support for the Software under this Agreement. 
	Support must be obtained via a separate agreement. However, Ardisia Labs LLC
	may, at its sole discretion, provide help via certain channels including, 
	but not limited to, forum access. Ardisia Labs LLC reserves the right to 
	discontinue such channels at any time.
</p>

<h3>
	10. UPDATES
</h3>
<p>
	You are entitled to receive all updates (minor and major) to the Software 
	for a period of 1 year from the initial date of the license purchase. 
	Updates may replace, add functionality, and may remove functionality from 
	the version of the Software that served as Your eligibility for the update. 
	You may use the updated Software only in accordance with the terms of this 
	License.
</p>
<p>
	If an option to purchase additional updates beyond the first year is 
	offered, such option will be governed by the terms and conditions spelled 
	out in a seperate renewal agreement.
</p>

<h3>
	11. BUGS AND APACHE FLEX
</h3>
<p>
	The Software has bugs in it.  It will not operate uninterrupted or error 
	free. You agree and acknowledge that You are aware of this before purchase 
	and that the Software is provided 'AS IS'.
</p>
<p>
	Also, the Software is intended to work with Apache Flex, but We make no 
	representations or warranties that the Software will work correctly with 
	Apache Flex and You hereby acknowledge that is not practicable for Us to do 
	so. Apache Flex is enormous and changes very often.  Therefore, it is very 
	likely that problems with Apache Flex and the Software will arise.
